# udp_log_forwarder Project Initialization Plan (Memory Bank)

## Purpose
This file documents the vision, roadmap, and initialization steps for transforming `udp_log_forwarder` into a robust, production-grade, open-source logging solution. It is intended as a persistent reference for onboarding, planning, and memory bank initialization in the new repository.

---

## Vision
- Provide a lightweight, fast, and secure UDP-based logging utility for Python and shell environments.
- Support both log forwarding (client) and log collection (listener/server), with extensibility for cloud and on-premise use.
- Make it easy to integrate, monitor, and scale logging in any environment (dev, prod, local, remote).

---

## Roadmap
### A. Listener/Server
- [ ] Async I/O UDP listener (scalable, non-blocking)
- [ ] Batching & disk persistence (JSONL, CSV, pluggable sinks)
- [ ] S3/MinIO integration as a batch sink (with unique container name for project isolation)
- [ ] Multi-thread/process support
- [ ] Integrations (Elasticsearch, etc.)
- [ ] Health check endpoint (HTTP)

### B. Forwarder/Client
- [ ] Non-blocking/async sending
- [ ] Queueing/retry logic
- [ ] Compression support
- [ ] TLS/Encryption

### C. General Improvements
- [ ] Config file support (YAML/JSON)
- [ ] Metrics/monitoring (Prometheus/StatsD)
- [ ] Extensive testing & stress tests
- [ ] Docker image for listener
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### D. Documentation & Usability
- [ ] Advanced usage examples (cloud, Docker, K8s, etc.)
- [ ] Contribution guidelines
- [ ] Roadmap/issues list
- [ ] Badges (PyPI, CI, coverage)

---

## Initialization Steps
1. Scaffold package structure and documentation (DONE)
2. Add async UDP listener (next step)
3. Incrementally add features from the roadmap
4. Update README and onboarding docs as features land
5. Use this file as a living memory bank for project direction

---

## S3/MinIO Integration Notes
- The udp_log_forwarder repo will include a dedicated MinIO service in its docker-compose (e.g., `minio_udp_log_forwarder`) to avoid conflicts with other MinIO instances.
- Listener will support env/config for S3 endpoint, keys, bucket, and batch settings.
- Example usage and docker-compose will be provided for both local and cloud scenarios.

---

## Usage in Memory Bank
- Reference this file in all onboarding and planning discussions.
- Update as features are added, priorities shift, or new contributors join.
- Use as the single source of truth for project goals and technical direction.

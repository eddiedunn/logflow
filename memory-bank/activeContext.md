# Active Context: logflow

**Current Work Focus:**
- Ensuring fully automated, isolated, and robust containerized test workflow for logflow.
- Maintaining up-to-date documentation in the Memory Bank and README.
- Creating and populating the six core documentation files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md.

**Recent Changes:**
- Created the `memory-bank/` directory and all required core files.
- Populated `projectbrief.md` with a detailed project overview, vision, and key features.
- Populated `productContext.md` with rationale, problems solved, operational approach, and user experience goals.
- Refactored all integration tests to use a stop_event for UDP server shutdown, ensuring no port conflicts or lingering threads.
- Updated batching/upload logic to catch and log all exceptions, preventing thread errors and warnings.
- All tests (unit and integration) now pass cleanly in Docker Compose with no warnings.
- README updated with clear instructions for running the full test suite in a containerized environment.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue populating remaining Memory Bank files:
  - systemPatterns.md: Document system architecture, design patterns, and component relationships.
  - techContext.md: Outline technologies used, setup, constraints, and dependencies.
  - progress.md: Track current status, what works, what remains, and known issues.
- Add CI/CD automation using the same docker-compose test workflow.
- Continue to expand test coverage and documentation.
- Begin implementation or review of core logflow features (UDP ingestion, batching, S3 integration, etc.) as outlined in projectbrief.md.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**
- Prioritizing clear, maintainable documentation to support ongoing development and onboarding.
- Ensuring the Memory Bank remains up-to-date as the project evolves.
- Focusing on extensibility and minimal dependencies in all design and implementation choices.
- Prioritizing test isolation and cleanup to prevent resource conflicts.
- All test and dev workflows should use the documented Docker Compose commands for reliability.

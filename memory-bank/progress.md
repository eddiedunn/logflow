# Progress: logflow

**What Works (Verified):**
- UDP log forwarding via Python logging handler (`UDPJsonLogHandler`) and CLI utility.
- Async UDP server for log collection (`UDPHandler`, `udp_server`).
- Batching by size and time in the server loop; minimal batching by count in `LogBatcher`.
- S3/MinIO sink for batch upload (via boto3).
- Disk sink for batch writing as `.jsonl` files (tested via integration).
- Health check endpoint (`/healthz` via aiohttp).
- Docker Compose setup for MinIO and logflow listener.
- Fully automated, isolated, and robust containerized test workflow using Docker Compose.
- All integration and unit tests pass with no warnings or thread exceptions.
- README includes up-to-date test and workflow instructions.

**What Is Partially Implemented or Missing:**
- No formal plugin/interface for extensible sinks (only S3 and disk implemented).
- `LogBatcher` does not batch by time, only by count.
- No Python logging handler for disk/S3 sinks (only UDP).
- Monitoring/metrics limited to health check; no advanced observability.
- CLI is basic; lacks advanced options.
- Limited in-code documentation and examples.
- Tests only cover core logic and main integration flows.

**Current Status:**
- All core features are functional and tested in a containerized environment.
- Project is ready for extension (plugin sinks, more tests, advanced CLI, etc).

**Known Issues:**
- More tests and documentation needed for production readiness.
- CI/CD automation is the next priority.
